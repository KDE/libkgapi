LibKGoogle
========================

LibKGoogle is a C++ library that implements APIs for various Google
services, including Google Contacts, Google Calendars and Google Tasks.

Dependencies:
-------------
  - KDE Libraries >= 4.7.0
  - KDEPIM Libraries >= 4.6 (version >= 4.4 supported with -DUSE_KCAL=TRUE switch, see below)
  - QJSON
  - Boost (when using -DUSE_KCAL=TRUE switch)

  make install

Backwards compatibility with KDEPIM 4.4:
----------------------------------------
If you want to use this resources with KDEPIM Libraries >= 4.4, you can run cmake with -DUSE_KCAL=TRUE.
This switch will enable backwards compatibility with old KDEPIM Libraries by using obsolete KCal API 
instead of new KCalCore API. During compilation you will see lot of deprecation warning, but it's OK.
