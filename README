LibKGAPI
========================

LibKGAPI (previously called LibKGoogle) is a C++ library that implements APIs for
various Google services.

Currently supported APIs:
  - Calendar API v3 (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar)
  - Contacts API v3 (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/)
  - Tasks API v1 (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks)
  - Latitude API v1 (https://developers.google.com/latitude/v1/)
  - Static Google Maps API v2 (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/)


Dependencies:
-------------
  - KDE Libraries >= 4.7.0
  - KDEPIM Libraries >= 4.11
  - QJSON

Compiling:
----------

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
  make
  # As root:
  make install

If you intend to use LibKGAPI with KDE 4.11 or newer, you can run CMake with
-DKGAPI_DISABLE_DEPRECATED=TRUE argument to skip building deprecated LibKGAPI API.
This will become default in next version. The KDE <=4.10 compatibility API will be
dropped later during 2.x cycle.

To compile example applications, run cmake with -DKGAPI_BUILD_EXAMPLES=TRUE argument.
To compile automated tests, run 'make buildtests'. To run automated tests, run 'make test'
