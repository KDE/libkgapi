LibKGAPI
========================

LibKGAPI (previously called LibKGoogle) is a C++ library that implements APIs for
various Google services.

  - Contacts API v3 (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/)
  - Tasks API v1 (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks)


Dependencies:
-------------
  - KDE Libraries >= 4.7.0
  - KDEPIM Libraries >= 4.6 (version >= 4.4 supported with -DUSE_KCAL=TRUE switch, see below)
  - QJSON
  - Boost (when using -DUSE_KCAL=TRUE switch)


Compiling:
----------

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
  make
  # As root:
  make install

BUGS:
-----
Submit bugs and feature requests to KDE bugzilla, product libkgapi:

Backwards compatibility with KDEPIM 4.4:
----------------------------------------
If you want to use this resources with KDEPIM Libraries >= 4.4, you can run cmake with -DUSE_KCAL=TRUE.
This switch will enable backwards compatibility with old KDEPIM Libraries by using obsolete KCal API 
instead of new KCalCore API. During compilation you will see lot of deprecation warning, but it's OK.
