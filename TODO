=======

Feel free to implement any of the tasks below. If you start working
on something, please let me know so that you or someone else would
not waist effort and time by reinventing the wheel.

libKGoogle
----------
  - complete support for contacts and calendars
  - add support for contact groups in Contacts service
  - add support for timezones in recurrent events



In some distant future, when Akregator is ported to Akonadi too, I'd
like to have support for Google Feeds
