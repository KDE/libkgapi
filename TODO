TODO
=======

Feel free to implement any of the tasks below. If you start working
on something, please let me know so that you or someone else would
not waist effort and time on reinventing wheel.

libKGoogle
----------
  - create common API for creating request on Google API
  - create common API for parsing Google's replies
 
Contacts resource
-----------------
  - fetching photos
  - modifying contacts
  - creating contacts
  - removing contacts

Calendar resource
-----------------
  - retrieving events
  - modifying events
  - creating events
  - removing events


Task list resource (To-do)
------------------
  This actually depends on how much are tasks and calendar events separated
  in Google and in Akonadi. I haven't looked on this yet, as there's still a
  long way to this point.

  - retrieving tasks
  - modifying tasks
  - creating tasks
  - removing tasks


In some distant future, when Akregator is ported to Akonadi too, I'd
like to have support for Google Feeds
